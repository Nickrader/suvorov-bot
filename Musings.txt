Musings::Suvorov Bot

SuvBot uses .cpp file to schedule a build order.  Also in .cpp file leaves room to implement some logic.
e.g. MarinePush.cpp
That file is called in 'void Dispatcher::OnGameStart()' in Dispatcher.cpp

--------------------------------------------------------------------
General::

1.  Check refinery has no more than 3 workers...
	check # of workers?  Do always want 3 per geyser? yes, unless special case.
	
2.  Create zone (semi-circle, triangle, trapezoid, etc.) where building does not occur (mineral/gas lines)
	cache point2d refinery, minerals.  
	operate on those values to create range or list of values to not build on.
	(more advanced chache map info and use that.)
	

3.  Place first depot at main ramp edge.  
	Mapanalyzer may be helpful on this.  Or hardcoding locations based on ladder map used? 
	(more try-hard, less automated/derived/generic)

4.  natual expansion should make OC before making 1st SCV.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** need to supply map path on command line **
.\Suvorov.exe "Ladder2019Season3/AcropolisLE.SC2Map"

GameLoops per second = 22.4

 Eventually, it would be best to use a cached build_grid (0.5x0.5 cells) and mark those cells as reserved/off-limits
		which intersect a line segment between the base and each mineral/geyser.
