Zapp Brannigan:

ZappBrannigan.cpp


1	if command center is idle, make SCV
1  if barracks is idle, make marine

2  if minerals is greater than 150 and NOT build expansion,  make barracks 

3  build_expansion() ; if barracks less-than X[Y], where Y is the number of expansions, 
																				build rax,
																				else expo.
X:		Y:
3				1
5				2
9				3
13			4

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
start off simple:

uses a build order scheduler. (schedule obligatory build order) [not OnGameStart(), use OnStep()]
only want to schedule building if resource trigger. (OnStep)
want constant SCV and Marine production (OnIdle)
